# Plasma
A game launcher designed for systems incapable of running steam. Useful for people who have a ton of manually installed games.

Plasma is designed similarly to classic steam. All you do is click "Add Game", insert the metadata, and you're golden!
All you need is a computer running Windows XP and Microsoft .Net 3.5
